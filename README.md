# chartChek: Compliance Assistant for Behavioral Health Facilities

Welcome to **chartChek**, an advanced AI-powered compliance assistant designed to simplify and streamline regulatory compliance for **mental health and substance-abuse recovery centers**. Built on state-of-the-art natural language processing and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology, chartChek provides instant, accurate, and actionable insights tailored to each facility's unique requirements.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to serve as a **Joint Commission/DHCS compliance assistant**, equipping behavioral health facilities with an intuitive chatbot to assist in navigating regulatory standards, tracking compliance, and managing documentation. Each instance of chartChek can be customized with facility-specific information, making it a highly adaptable tool.

- Embeds the extracted data into a vector database for fast, context-aware lookups.

### 2. **Regulatory Knowledge Base**
- Preloaded with knowledge from **Joint Commission** and **DHCS** standards.
- Enables seamless RAG lookups to answer compliance-related queries.

### 3. **Custom Facility Information**
- Facility-specific customization for proprietary policies, procedures, and workflows.
- Allows authenticated users to add, update, and manage internal documents.

### 4. **Smart Compliance Assistance**
- Provides detailed answers and explanations to compliance-related questions.
- Generates summaries, documentation checklists, and actionable insights.

### 5. **Authentication and Scalability**
- Cloneable for each authenticated user or facility.
- Secure storage and management of proprietary facility data.

### 6. **Proactive Compliance Monitoring** *(Future Version)*
- Tracks changes in regulatory standards.
- Notifies users about updates and how they impact their facility.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Data Processing**:
   - Text is extracted from regulatory documents (PDFs, manuals, etc.) using robust OCR and text-parsing libraries.
   - Extracted text is converted into vector embeddings for efficient querying.

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
   - Combines OpenAI's GPT capabilities with vector database queries.
   - Ensures responses are both contextually accurate and grounded in source data.

3. **Custom Facility Instances**:
   - Each user gets a unique assistant with their proprietary data layered over the shared knowledge base.
   - Facility-specific data remains secure and isolated.
  
# Development Framework:

## 1. Chatbot Development:
**Objective: Build an interactive chatbot interface for user queries.**
-Integrate the chatbot with the vector store / embedding database (OpenAI Assistant) to provide relevant responses.
-Ensure the chatbot can handle a variety of queries related to compliance and documentation.

## 2. Compliance Tracking and Reporting:
**Objective: Enable tracking of compliance status and generate reports.**
-Create features to monitor adherence to specific standards.
-Develop reporting tools to summarize compliance status and highlight areas needing attention.

## 3. Document Processing Module:
**Objective: Develop a robust system to extract and process text from various document formats.**
-Implement Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction from scanned documents.
-Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to clean and structure the extracted text.

## 4. Customization Features:
**Objective: Allow facilities to input their specific information and policies.**
-Develop an interface for users to upload and manage their documents.
-Implement mechanisms to tailor responses based on facility-specific data.


## #. Embedding and Storage (currently these requirements are satisified by OpenAI's Assistant module, which provides API access)
**Objective: Create embeddings of the processed text for efficient retrieval.**
-Use pre-trained language models to generate text embeddings.
-Store embeddings in a database optimized for quick search and retrieval.

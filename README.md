## Architecture Overview

1. **Data Processing**:
   - Text is extracted from regulatory documents (PDFs, manuals, etc.) using robust OCR and text-parsing libraries.
   - Extracted text is converted into vector embeddings for efficient querying.

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
   - Combines OpenAI's GPT capabilities with vector database queries.
   - Ensures responses are both contextually accurate and grounded in source data.

3. **Custom Facility Instances**:
   - Each user gets a unique assistant with their proprietary data layered over the shared knowledge base.
   - Facility-specific data remains secure and isolated.

4. **Deployment Options**:
   - Hosted on a cloud platform for scalability.
   - API access for integration with existing facility management systems.
